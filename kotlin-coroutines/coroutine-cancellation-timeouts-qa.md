## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **What is coroutine cancellation?**
   > Coroutine cancellation is the process of stopping a coroutine before it has completed its execution.

2. **How do you cancel a coroutine?**
   > You can cancel a coroutine by calling the cancel() method on its Job or its parent CoroutineScope.

3. **What is a CancellationException?**
   > CancellationException is a special exception that's used to cancel the execution of a coroutine. It's generally ignored by the coroutine machinery.

4. **What happens when a coroutine is cancelled?**
   > When a coroutine is cancelled, it throws a CancellationException at its next suspension point.

5. **How can you check if a coroutine is active?**
   > You can check if a coroutine is active by accessing the isActive property of its Job or CoroutineScope.

6. **What is a timeout in the context of coroutines?**
   > A timeout in coroutines is a mechanism to automatically cancel a coroutine if it doesn't complete within a specified time period.

7. **How do you set a timeout for a coroutine?**
   > You can set a timeout for a coroutine using the withTimeout or withTimeoutOrNull functions.

8. **What's the difference between withTimeout and withTimeoutOrNull?**
   > withTimeout throws a TimeoutCancellationException if the timeout is exceeded, while withTimeoutOrNull returns null in case of a timeout.

9. **Can a cancelled coroutine be restarted?**
   > No, once a coroutine is cancelled, it cannot be restarted. You need to create a new coroutine.

10. **What happens to child coroutines when their parent is cancelled?**
    > When a parent coroutine is cancelled, all its child coroutines are automatically cancelled as well.

</details>

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **How does cooperative cancellation work in Kotlin coroutines?**
    > Cooperative cancellation means that coroutines check for cancellation at suspension points and decide how to respond. They can perform cleanup operations before completing.

12. **What is the purpose of the ensureActive() function?**
    > ensureActive() is used to check if the current coroutine is still active and throw a CancellationException if it's not. It's useful for making non-suspending functions cancellable.

13. **How can you make a coroutine non-cancellable?**
    > You can use the withContext(NonCancellable) { ... } block to make a section of code non-cancellable.

14. **What is the relationship between coroutine cancellation and exceptions?**
    > Coroutine cancellation is closely related to exception handling. Cancellation throws a CancellationException, which is a special exception used for coroutine cancellation.

15. **How does cancellation affect structured concurrency?**
    > In structured concurrency, cancellation propagates through the coroutine hierarchy. When a parent coroutine is cancelled, all its children are cancelled too.

16. **What is the difference between cancel() and cancelAndJoin()?**
    > cancel() initiates cancellation but returns immediately, while cancelAndJoin() initiates cancellation and then suspends until the coroutine completes.

17. **How can you implement a custom timeout strategy?**
    > You can implement a custom timeout strategy by using launch with a delay, and then cancelling the main job if the delay completes before the main work.

18. **What happens if an exception is thrown during cancellation?**
    > If an exception is thrown during cancellation (other than CancellationException), it's treated as a failure and propagated to the parent coroutine.

19. **How do you handle resources in case of cancellation?**
    > You can use try-finally blocks or use() functions to ensure resources are properly closed or released when a coroutine is cancelled.

20. **What is the purpose of the invokeOnCompletion handler?**
    > invokeOnCompletion allows you to register a handler that will be called when a coroutine completes, whether normally, by exception, or by cancellation.

## 🎓 Hard Questions

21. **How would you implement a custom cancellable suspending function?**
    > To implement a custom cancellable suspending function:
    > - Use suspendCancellableCoroutine to create the suspending function
    > - Check for cancellation regularly using ensureActive() or yield()
    > - Register cancellation handlers to clean up resources
    > - Ensure the continuation is resumed only once, even in case of cancellation

22. **What are the challenges in cancelling CPU-intensive operations, and how can they be addressed?**
    > Challenges in cancelling CPU-intensive operations include:
    > - Operations may not hit suspension points frequently
    > - Cancellation checks can impact performance
    > Solutions include:
    > - Manually inserting cancellation checks (e.g., ensureActive()) at appropriate intervals
    > - Using yield() to cooperate with cancellation and other coroutines
    > - Splitting long-running operations into smaller, cancellable chunks

23. **How can you implement a timeout that affects multiple coroutines simultaneously?**
    > To implement a timeout affecting multiple coroutines:
    > - Use a shared Job as a parent for all coroutines
    > - Launch a separate coroutine for the timeout using delay
    > - Cancel the shared parent Job when the timeout coroutine completes
    > - Use SupervisorJob if you want some coroutines to continue despite others being cancelled

24. **What are the implications of using withTimeout in a hierarchy of coroutines, and how can potential issues be mitigated?**
    > Implications of using withTimeout in a coroutine hierarchy:
    > - Timeout cancellation propagates to child coroutines
    > - Nested timeouts may interact in unexpected ways
    > Mitigation strategies:
    > - Use withTimeoutOrNull for more graceful handling
    > - Carefully consider timeout durations at different levels of the hierarchy
    > - Use SupervisorJob to isolate timeout cancellations when necessary
    > - Implement custom timeout logic for complex scenarios

25. **How would you design a cancellation system for long-running background tasks that need to persist across process restarts?**
    > Design considerations for such a system:
    > - Use a persistent storage (e.g., database) to store task state and progress
    > - Implement a task ID system for unique identification
    > - Create a coroutine-based task manager that can resume tasks from their last known state
    > - Use atomic operations for updating task status to handle process termination
    > - Implement a cancellation flag in the persistent storage
    > - Regularly check the cancellation flag and persist progress during execution
    > - Use WorkManager or similar for scheduling and managing background work

26. **How can you implement a "cancel on timeout, but finish current work" behavior in coroutines?**
    > Implementation approach:
    > - Use async to start the work
    > - Use withTimeoutOrNull with a longer timeout than the expected execution time
    > - Inside withTimeoutOrNull, await the result of the async job
    > - If withTimeoutOrNull returns null, cancel the async job but allow it to finish its current operation
    > - Use a custom dispatcher or worker thread for the async job to ensure it can complete its current work

27. **What are the best practices for handling cancellation in a coroutine-based actor system?**
    > Best practices include:
    > - Using SupervisorJob for the actor system to isolate actor failures
    > - Implementing graceful shutdown procedures for actors
    > - Using channels with appropriate buffer strategies to handle message backpressure during cancellation
    > - Implementing timeout logic for inter-actor communication
    > - Ensuring actors check for cancellation regularly and clean up resources
    > - Using select statements with onCancellation clauses for complex communication patterns

28. **How would you implement a custom coroutine dispatcher that supports priority-based cancellation?**
    > Implementation approach:
    > - Create a custom CoroutineDispatcher class
    > - Maintain a priority queue of runnable coroutines
    > - Implement a custom Job class that includes priority information
    > - Override the dispatch method to enqueue runnables based on priority
    > - Implement a custom cancel method that cancels coroutines based on priority
    > - Ensure thread-safety for all operations on the priority queue

29. **What are the challenges and solutions for implementing cancellation and timeouts in a distributed system using coroutines?**
    > Challenges and solutions:
    > - Coordinating cancellation across multiple services: Use distributed tracing and correlation IDs
    > - Handling partial failures: Implement compensating transactions or saga pattern
    > - Managing timeouts across service boundaries: Use cascading timeouts or implement a distributed timeout manager
    > - Ensuring consistency during cancellation: Use two-phase commit protocols or eventual consistency models
    > - Handling network partitions: Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
    > - Debugging cancelled operations: Use comprehensive logging and monitoring systems

30. **How would you design a coroutine-based system for managing long-running transactions with support for cancellation, timeouts, and savepoints?**
    > Design considerations:
    > - Use a persistent store (e.g., database) to track transaction state and savepoints
    > - Implement a transaction manager coroutine that oversees the entire transaction lifecycle
    > - Break down the transaction into smaller, atomic operations that can be suspended
    > - Use flows or channels to stream transaction steps and results
    > - Implement custom timeout logic that allows for extending timeouts at savepoints
    > - Use supervisorScope to isolate failures in individual transaction steps
    > - Implement a rollback mechanism that can be triggered on cancellation or timeout
    > - Use coroutine-based locks or semaphores to manage concurrency and resource access
    > - Provide hooks for custom cancellation logic at different stages of the transaction
