## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **What is asynchronous programming?**
   > Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows operations to be executed independently of the main program flow, enabling non-blocking execution of tasks.

2. **How do coroutines facilitate asynchronous programming in Kotlin?**
   > Coroutines provide a way to write asynchronous code in a sequential manner, making it easier to understand and maintain compared to traditional callback-based approaches.

3. **What is a suspend function in Kotlin?**
   > A suspend function is a function that can be paused and resumed later, allowing other coroutines to run in the meantime. It's marked with the `suspend` keyword.

4. **How do you start a coroutine?**
   > You can start a coroutine using coroutine builders like `launch` or `async` within a coroutine scope.

5. **What is the difference between `launch` and `async`?**
   > `launch` starts a coroutine and returns a Job, while `async` starts a coroutine and returns a Deferred that can provide a result.

6. **What is a coroutine scope?**
   > A coroutine scope defines the lifetime of coroutines. It manages the coroutines launched within it and ensures they are cancelled when the scope is cancelled.

7. **How do you handle exceptions in asynchronous coroutine code?**
   > You can use try-catch blocks within coroutines or use exception handlers like `CoroutineExceptionHandler`.

8. **What is the purpose of the `await()` function?**
   > `await()` is used to retrieve the result of a Deferred object returned by `async`. It suspends the coroutine until the result is available.

9. **How do you cancel a coroutine?**
   > You can cancel a coroutine by calling the `cancel()` function on its Job or on the parent coroutine scope.

10. **What is the main advantage of using coroutines for asynchronous programming?**
    > Coroutines allow writing asynchronous code in a sequential, synchronous-like manner, improving readability and maintainability.

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **How does `withContext` facilitate asynchronous programming?**
    > `withContext` allows you to switch the context of a coroutine, enabling you to perform operations on different dispatchers without blocking the current thread.

12. **What is the purpose of the `yield()` function in coroutines?**
    > `yield()` is used to give other coroutines a chance to execute, helping to prevent monopolization of the thread by a single coroutine.

13. **How can you implement a timeout for an asynchronous operation using coroutines?**
    > You can use the `withTimeout` or `withTimeoutOrNull` functions to set a timeout for a coroutine operation.

14. **What is the difference between `runBlocking` and `coroutineScope`?**
    > `runBlocking` blocks the current thread and creates a coroutine scope, while `coroutineScope` suspends the current coroutine and creates a new scope without blocking the thread.

15. **How do you handle concurrent asynchronous operations with coroutines?**
    > You can use `async` to start multiple coroutines concurrently and then use `await()` to collect their results, or use functions like `awaitAll()` for collections of deferred values.

16. **What is the purpose of the `select` expression in coroutines?**
    > `select` allows you to await multiple suspending functions simultaneously and proceed with the first one that becomes available.

17. **How can you convert a callback-based API to use coroutines?**
    > You can use the `suspendCoroutine` or `suspendCancellableCoroutine` function to wrap a callback-based API in a suspend function.

18. **What is the difference between `flow` and `channelFlow` in asynchronous programming?**
    > `flow` is used for cold streams that are computed on demand, while `channelFlow` is used for hot streams that can emit values concurrently with their collection.

19. **How do you handle backpressure in asynchronous coroutine-based streams?**
    > You can use operators like `buffer`, `conflate`, or `collectLatest` on flows to handle backpressure, or use channels with appropriate capacities.

20. **What is the purpose of the `supervisorScope` in asynchronous error handling?**
    > `supervisorScope` creates a scope where failures of children don't affect their siblings or the parent, allowing for more granular error handling in asynchronous operations.
