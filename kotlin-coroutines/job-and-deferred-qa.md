## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **What is a Job in Kotlin Coroutines?**
   > A Job is a cancellable thing with a lifecycle. It represents the lifecycle of a coroutine and can be used to control and monitor its execution.

2. **How do you create a new Job?**
   > You can create a new Job using the Job() constructor or by launching a new coroutine using launch or async, which returns a Job.

3. **What are the main states of a Job?**
   > The main states of a Job are New, Active, Completing, Completed, Cancelling, and Cancelled.

4. **How do you cancel a Job?**
   > You can cancel a Job by calling the cancel() method on it.

5. **What is the difference between a Job and a Deferred?**
   > A Deferred is a Job that produces a result. It's typically created by the async coroutine builder and can be awaited using await().

6. **How do you wait for a Job to complete?**
   > You can wait for a Job to complete by calling the join() method, which is a suspending function.

7. **What happens when you cancel a Job that has child Jobs?**
   > When you cancel a Job, all its child Jobs are cancelled recursively.

8. **How can you check if a Job is active?**
   > You can check if a Job is active by accessing its isActive property.

9. **What is the purpose of the start() method on a Job?**
   > The start() method is used to start a lazy coroutine that was created with CoroutineStart.LAZY.

10. **How do you get the result of a Deferred?**
    > You can get the result of a Deferred by calling its await() method, which is a suspending function.

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **What is the difference between a "hot" Job and a "cold" Job?**
    > A "hot" Job starts executing immediately when created, while a "cold" Job (created with CoroutineStart.LAZY) doesn't start until explicitly started or joined.

12. **How does Job cancellation relate to coroutine scope cancellation?**
    > Cancelling a Job will cancel its coroutine scope and all coroutines launched in that scope. Conversely, cancelling a coroutine scope will cancel its Job and all child Jobs.

13. **What is the purpose of the SupervisorJob?**
    > A SupervisorJob allows child coroutines to fail independently without affecting their siblings or the parent Job. It's useful for implementing supervisor scope.

14. **How can you convert a callback-based API to return a Deferred?**
    > You can use the CompletableDeferred class to create a Deferred that can be completed manually, allowing you to bridge callback-based APIs with coroutines.

15. **What happens if an exception is thrown in a coroutine with a Deferred result?**
    > If an exception is thrown in a coroutine with a Deferred result, the exception is stored in the Deferred and will be rethrown when await() is called.

16. **How does Job.join() differ from Deferred.await()?**
    > Job.join() simply waits for the Job to complete, while Deferred.await() waits for the Job to complete and returns its result (or throws an exception if the Job failed).

17. **What is the purpose of the invokeOnCompletion() method on a Job?**
    > invokeOnCompletion() allows you to register a handler that will be called when the Job completes, whether successfully or due to an exception.

18. **How can you create a timeout for a Job?**
    > You can create a timeout for a Job using the withTimeout() function, which will cancel the Job if it doesn't complete within the specified time.

19. **What is the relationship between a Job and a CoroutineContext?**
    > A Job is an element of a CoroutineContext. When you create a new coroutine, it typically inherits the context of its parent, including the Job.

20. **How does async() differ from launch() in terms of the returned Job type?**
    > async() returns a Deferred<T>, which is a subtype of Job that represents an asynchronous computation with a result. launch() returns a regular Job with no result.

</details>

## 🎓 Hard Questions

21. **How does structured concurrency relate to Job hierarchy?**
    > Structured concurrency is implemented through Job hierarchy. Child Jobs are automatically cancelled when their parent is cancelled, ensuring that no coroutines are left running unintentionally when their parent scope completes.

22. **What are the implications of using withContext() on the current Job?**
    > withContext() creates a new coroutine with a new Job, which becomes a child of the current Job. This allows for context switching while maintaining the proper Job hierarchy.

23. **How can you implement a custom Job that has additional state or behavior?**
    > You can implement a custom Job by extending the AbstractCoroutine class, which provides the basic Job implementation. This allows you to add custom state or override behavior as needed.

24. **What is the purpose of the Job.Key object, and how is it used in CoroutineContext?**
    > Job.Key is the key used to identify the Job element in a CoroutineContext. It's used when adding a Job to a context or retrieving it, e.g., coroutineContext[Job].

25. **How does exception handling work with nested Jobs and SupervisorJob?**
    > With regular Jobs, an exception in a child propagates to its parent, potentially cancelling siblings. With SupervisorJob, exceptions in children don't affect siblings or the parent, but uncaught exceptions can still propagate up if not handled.

26. **What are the performance implications of creating many short-lived Jobs versus fewer long-running Jobs?**
    > Creating many short-lived Jobs can incur overhead due to Job creation and management. Fewer long-running Jobs may be more efficient but could potentially block resources. The best approach depends on the specific use case and should be determined through profiling.

27. **How can you implement a Job that represents the completion of multiple other Jobs?**
    > You can use coroutineScope or a custom implementation that launches multiple coroutines and tracks their completion. Another approach is to use a CompletableJob and complete it manually when all child Jobs are done.

28. **What is the difference between coroutineScope and supervisorScope in terms of Job behavior?**
    > coroutineScope creates a scope where an exception in any child cancels all other children and the scope itself. supervisorScope creates a scope where children can fail independently without affecting siblings or the parent scope.

29. **How does the Job of a Flow collector relate to the Jobs of the Flow's intermediate operators?**
    > The Job of a Flow collector is typically independent of the Jobs created by the Flow's intermediate operators. Cancelling the collector Job will cancel the collection process, but may not immediately stop all operations in the Flow pipeline.

30. **What are the best practices for managing complex Job hierarchies in large-scale applications?**
    > Best practices include:
    > - Using structured concurrency principles to ensure proper Job hierarchy
    > - Leveraging supervisorScope for independent child Jobs where appropriate
    > - Implementing proper exception handling at each level of the Job hierarchy
    > - Using Job names and custom Job implementations for better debugging and monitoring
    > - Carefully managing Job lifecycles to prevent leaks and ensure timely cancellation
    > - Considering the use of flow for complex asynchronous data streams
