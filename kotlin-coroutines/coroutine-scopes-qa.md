## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **What is a coroutine scope?**
   > A coroutine scope is a context that manages the lifecycle of coroutines. It defines the boundaries within which coroutines operate.

2. **Why are coroutine scopes important?**
   > Scopes help manage the lifecycle of coroutines, prevent leaks, and ensure proper cancellation of coroutines when they're no longer needed.

3. **What is the purpose of `CoroutineScope()`?**
   > `CoroutineScope()` creates a new coroutine scope that can be used to launch coroutines.

4. **What is `GlobalScope`?**
   > `GlobalScope` is a top-level scope that lasts for the entire lifetime of the application.

5. **How do you create a new coroutine within a scope?**
   > Use the `launch` or `async` functions on a coroutine scope, e.g., `scope.launch { ... }`.

6. **What happens to child coroutines when a scope is cancelled?**
   > When a scope is cancelled, all its child coroutines are automatically cancelled as well.

7. **What is the difference between `launch` and `async` when used with a scope?**
   > `launch` starts a new coroutine without returning a result, while `async` starts a coroutine that returns a `Deferred` result.

8. **How can you create a coroutine scope that's bound to a specific lifecycle?**
   > Use lifecycle-aware coroutine scopes provided by libraries like `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx`.

9. **What is the purpose of `MainScope()`?**
   > `MainScope()` creates a scope that dispatches coroutines on the main thread by default.

10. **How do you properly cancel a coroutine scope?**
    > Call the `cancel()` function on the scope, e.g., `scope.cancel()`.

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **What is structured concurrency, and how does it relate to coroutine scopes?**
    > Structured concurrency is a concept where coroutines are organized in a parent-child hierarchy. Coroutine scopes implement this by ensuring that when a parent scope is cancelled, all its child coroutines are cancelled too.

12. **How does `coroutineScope` function differ from `CoroutineScope()`?**
    > `coroutineScope` is a suspending function that creates a new scope and doesn't complete until all launched children complete. `CoroutineScope()` is a constructor that creates a new scope without suspending.

13. **What is a supervisor scope, and when would you use it?**
    > A supervisor scope is a coroutine scope where the failure of a child coroutine doesn't affect its siblings or the parent. It's useful when you want to handle failures of individual child coroutines independently.

14. **How can you change the dispatcher of a coroutine within a scope?**
    > Use `withContext(Dispatchers.X) { ... }` to switch to a different dispatcher for a specific block of code.

15. **What is the purpose of `Job()` in relation to coroutine scopes?**
    > `Job()` creates a new job object that can be used to control the lifecycle of coroutines within a scope. It can be passed to `CoroutineScope()` to create a new scope with that job.

16. **How do exception handlers work with coroutine scopes?**
    > Exception handlers can be added to a scope using `CoroutineExceptionHandler`. They catch uncaught exceptions in coroutines launched within that scope.

17. **What is the difference between `runBlocking` and `coroutineScope`?**
    > `runBlocking` blocks the current thread and creates a coroutine scope, while `coroutineScope` suspends the current coroutine and creates a new scope without blocking the thread.

18. **How can you create a custom coroutine scope with specific properties?**
    > Combine different context elements like `Job()`, `Dispatchers`, and `CoroutineName` when creating a new `CoroutineScope`.

19. **What happens if an exception is thrown in a coroutine launched with `launch`?**
    > The exception propagates to the parent scope and cancels the entire scope and its other children, unless a `SupervisorJob` or exception handler is used.

20. **How does `async` behave differently from `launch` in terms of exception handling within a scope?**
    > Exceptions in `async` coroutines are deferred until the result is awaited, while exceptions in `launch` are thrown immediately and propagate to the parent scope.

</details>

## 🎓 Hard Questions

21. **How can you implement a custom scope that automatically cancels after a timeout?**
    > Create a custom scope that launches a delayed cancellation job when the scope is created, and cancels this job when the scope is no longer needed.

22. **What are the implications of using `GlobalScope` in a large application, and how can you mitigate potential issues?**
    > `GlobalScope` can lead to memory leaks and make testing difficult. Mitigate by using scoped coroutines, dependency injection for scopes, or creating application-level scopes with proper lifecycle management.

23. **How can you implement a scope that limits the number of concurrent coroutines?**
    > Use a custom `CoroutineDispatcher` with a fixed thread pool or semaphores to limit the number of concurrent executions within a scope.

24. **What is the relationship between `CoroutineContext` and coroutine scopes?**
    > A `CoroutineScope` is essentially a wrapper around a `CoroutineContext`. The scope uses the context to determine how coroutines are executed and managed.

25. **How can you create a hierarchical structure of scopes that mirrors your application's architecture?**
    > Create parent scopes for major components of your application, and derive child scopes for subcomponents. This allows for fine-grained control over coroutine lifecycles.

26. **How does scope inheritance work in nested coroutine builders, and how can you override inherited scope properties?**
    > Child coroutines inherit the context of their parent scope. You can override specific elements by providing a new context when launching a coroutine, e.g., `launch(Dispatchers.IO) { ... }`.

27. **What are the best practices for managing scopes in a complex, multi-module Android application?**
    > Use a combination of lifecycle-aware scopes, dependency injection for scope provisioning, and custom scopes for specific use cases. Avoid global scopes and ensure proper cancellation.

28. **How can you implement a custom `CoroutineScope` that logs all coroutine activities within it?**
    > Create a custom `CoroutineScope` with a context that includes a custom `CoroutineDispatcher` which logs activities before delegating to the actual dispatcher.

29. **What are the performance implications of creating many short-lived scopes vs. reusing a long-lived scope?**
    > Creating many short-lived scopes can incur overhead, while long-lived scopes might lead to resource leaks if not managed properly. Balance based on your specific use case and measure performance.

30. **How can you implement a scope that prioritizes certain coroutines over others?**
    > Create a custom `CoroutineDispatcher` that uses a priority queue to manage coroutine execution order within the scope.
