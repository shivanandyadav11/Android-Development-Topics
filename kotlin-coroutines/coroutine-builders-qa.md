## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **What are coroutine builders in Kotlin?**
   > Coroutine builders are functions that create and start coroutines. The main builders are launch, async, and runBlocking.

2. **What is the purpose of the launch coroutine builder?**
   > launch is used to start a new coroutine without returning a result. It returns a Job that can be used to manage the coroutine's lifecycle.

3. **How does the async coroutine builder differ from launch?**
   > async is similar to launch, but it returns a Deferred object that represents a future result of the coroutine. This result can be retrieved using the await() function.

4. **What is runBlocking used for?**
   > runBlocking is used to bridge between regular blocking code and suspending functions. It blocks the current thread until all coroutines inside its block complete.

5. **Can you use suspend functions inside coroutine builders?**
   > Yes, you can use suspend functions inside coroutine builders. In fact, this is one of the main purposes of coroutine builders.

6. **What type of value does launch return?**
   > launch returns a Job object, which can be used to control the coroutine's lifecycle.

7. **How do you get the result from an async coroutine?**
   > You can get the result from an async coroutine by calling the await() function on the Deferred object returned by async.

8. **Is it possible to use launch inside a regular function?**
   > Yes, but you need to provide a CoroutineScope. This is often done by making the function an extension function on CoroutineScope.

9. **What happens if an exception is thrown inside a launch block?**
   > By default, an exception inside a launch block will be propagated to the parent coroutine and potentially crash the application if not handled.

10. **Can you use runBlocking in Android main thread?**
    > While it's possible, it's generally not recommended to use runBlocking in the Android main thread as it can lead to UI freezes and poor user experience.

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **How does the coroutine context affect coroutine builders?**
    > Coroutine builders inherit the context from their CoroutineScope, but you can also specify additional context elements when launching a coroutine. These will be merged with the inherited context.

12. **What is the difference between GlobalScope.launch and regular launch?**
    > GlobalScope.launch creates a top-level coroutine that operates independently of any job hierarchy. Regular launch creates a coroutine within the current scope, inheriting its context and becoming a child of the current job.

13. **How can you make a coroutine launched with launch return a value?**
    > While launch doesn't return a value directly, you can use a combination of CompletableDeferred and launch to achieve this. Alternatively, you could switch to using async.

14. **What is the purpose of the start parameter in launch and async?**
    > The start parameter allows you to control when the coroutine actually starts executing. For example, CoroutineStart.LAZY will create the coroutine but not start it until explicitly requested.

15. **How does exception handling differ between launch and async?**
    > Exceptions in launch are thrown immediately and propagated to the parent coroutine. In async, exceptions are deferred and thrown when await() is called.

16. **What is the relationship between coroutine builders and structured concurrency?**
    > Coroutine builders implement structured concurrency by creating parent-child relationships between coroutines. This ensures that when a parent coroutine is cancelled, all its children are cancelled as well.

17. **How can you use withContext with coroutine builders?**
    > withContext can be used inside a coroutine builder to temporarily switch the context of the coroutine. This is often used to switch dispatchers for specific operations.

18. **What is the purpose of the coroutineScope builder?**
    > coroutineScope creates a new coroutine scope and doesn't complete until all launched children complete. It's useful for performing concurrent operations.

19. **How does supervisorScope differ from coroutineScope?**
    > supervisorScope is similar to coroutineScope, but it creates a scope with a SupervisorJob. This means that a failure of a child coroutine doesn't affect its siblings.

20. **Can you nest coroutine builders? What are the implications?**
    > Yes, you can nest coroutine builders. Each nested coroutine becomes a child of the outer coroutine, following structured concurrency principles. This affects cancellation and exception propagation.

</details>

## 🎓 Hard Questions

21. **How would you implement your own custom coroutine builder?**
    > To implement a custom coroutine builder, you would typically use the suspendCoroutine or suspendCancellableCoroutine function to create a new coroutine, and then use startCoroutine to begin its execution. You'd need to handle the continuation and context management yourself.

22. **What are the performance implications of using runBlocking vs. launch in a server environment?**
    > runBlocking blocks the current thread, which can severely limit scalability in a server environment. launch, on the other hand, allows the thread to be reused for other tasks while the coroutine is suspended, leading to better resource utilization.

23. **How does the Job hierarchy work with nested async calls, and how does this affect error propagation?**
    > Nested async calls create a Job hierarchy. By default, exceptions in child Jobs are propagated to their parents. However, if a parent coroutine is cancelled while children are still running, the children will be cancelled but their exceptions won't be propagated to the parent.

24. **How can you implement a timeout for an async operation that properly cancels the operation if it exceeds the timeout?**
    > You can use the withTimeout function along with async. If the timeout is exceeded, withTimeout will cancel the async job and throw a TimeoutCancellationException. Alternatively, you can use the kotlinx-coroutines-time library for more advanced timeout handling.

25. **What are the challenges and best practices when using coroutine builders in lifecycle-aware components in Android?**
    > Challenges include preventing memory leaks and ensuring coroutines are cancelled when the lifecycle ends. Best practices involve using lifecycle-aware CoroutineScope like viewModelScope or lifecycleScope, and properly structuring coroutines to respect the component's lifecycle.

26. **How would you implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff using coroutine builders?**
    > You could create a custom suspend function that uses a loop with exponentially increasing delay times. This function would use launch or async internally, and could be combined with a timeout mechanism for additional control.

27. **What are the implications of using different dispatchers with coroutine builders in terms of thread safety and performance?**
    > Different dispatchers can affect both thread safety and performance. Using Dispatchers.Default for CPU-intensive tasks and Dispatchers.IO for I/O operations can improve performance. However, switching dispatchers frequently can introduce overhead. Thread safety must be carefully considered when using dispatchers that may run coroutines on different threads.

28. **How can you implement a fan-out/fan-in pattern using coroutine builders?**
    > You can use a combination of launch and async with channels or flows. For fan-out, you'd launch multiple coroutines to process data in parallel. For fan-in, you'd use a channel or flow to collect results from multiple coroutines into a single stream.

29. **What are the best practices for error handling and recovery in a system with deeply nested coroutine builders?**
    > Best practices include:
    > - Using supervisorScope to prevent failures in one branch from affecting others
    > - Implementing proper exception handling at each level
    > - Using coroutineScope for operations that should fail together
    > - Considering the use of a global error handler for unhandled exceptions
    > - Implementing retry mechanisms for recoverable errors
    > - Using structured concurrency principles to ensure proper cancellation and cleanup

30. **How would you design a coroutine-based system for managing and coordinating long-running background tasks with complex dependencies?**
    > This could involve:
    > - Creating a custom CoroutineScope for managing all tasks
    > - Using a combination of launch and async for different types of tasks
    > - Implementing a task dependency graph using Deferred results
    > - Using channels or flows for communication between tasks
    > - Implementing proper cancellation and error handling mechanisms
    > - Using supervisorScope for independent task groups
    > - Considering the use of coroutine-based actor pattern for managing shared state
    > - Implementing a custom dispatcher for controlling task execution and prioritization
