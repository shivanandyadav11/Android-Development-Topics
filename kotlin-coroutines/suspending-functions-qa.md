## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **What is a suspending function in Kotlin?**
   > A suspending function is a function that can be paused and resumed at a later time. It's a key concept in Kotlin coroutines that allows for asynchronous programming without blocking threads.

2. **How do you declare a suspending function?**
   > You declare a suspending function by adding the `suspend` keyword before the function declaration.

3. **Can regular functions call suspending functions directly?**
   > No, regular functions cannot call suspending functions directly. Suspending functions can only be called from within a coroutine or from another suspending function.

4. **What is the main advantage of using suspending functions?**
   > The main advantage is that they allow you to write asynchronous code in a sequential manner, making it easier to read and maintain compared to callback-based approaches.

5. **What happens when a suspending function is called?**
   > When a suspending function is called, it may suspend the execution of the current coroutine without blocking the underlying thread.

6. **Can suspending functions use regular Kotlin language features?**
   > Yes, suspending functions can use all regular Kotlin language features. The `suspend` keyword only affects how the function can be called and how it interacts with coroutines.

7. **What is the difference between a blocking function and a suspending function?**
   > A blocking function stops the execution of the thread it's running on, while a suspending function only suspends the coroutine, allowing the thread to be used for other tasks.

8. **Can you use try-catch blocks with suspending functions?**
   > Yes, you can use try-catch blocks with suspending functions just like with regular functions.

9. **What is a suspension point?**
   > A suspension point is a point in a suspending function where the function might suspend its execution, allowing other coroutines to run.

10. **Can suspending functions return values?**
    > Yes, suspending functions can return values just like regular functions.

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **What is the purpose of the `yield()` function in suspending functions?**
    > The `yield()` function is used to voluntarily suspend the current coroutine, allowing other coroutines to run. It's useful for ensuring fairness in coroutine execution and preventing long-running coroutines from hogging resources.

12. **How does exception handling work in suspending functions?**
    > Exception handling in suspending functions works similarly to regular functions. You can use try-catch blocks within the function. However, exceptions that escape a suspending function will be propagated to the coroutine that called it, potentially cancelling the coroutine.

13. **What is a continuation in the context of suspending functions?**
    > A continuation represents the state of a suspended coroutine. It contains information about where to resume execution when the coroutine is resumed. The Kotlin compiler uses continuations to implement the suspension and resumption mechanism of coroutines.

14. **Can suspending functions be used as higher-order functions?**
    > Yes, suspending functions can be used as higher-order functions. You can pass suspending functions as parameters or return them from other functions. The function type for a suspending function is prefixed with `suspend`, e.g., `suspend () -> Unit`.

15. **What is the difference between `runBlocking` and `coroutineScope`?**
    > Both `runBlocking` and `coroutineScope` create a coroutine scope, but `runBlocking` blocks the current thread until all coroutines inside it complete, while `coroutineScope` suspends the current coroutine without blocking the thread.

16. **How can you make a non-suspending function call a suspending function?**
    > To call a suspending function from a non-suspending context, you need to create a new coroutine. This can be done using coroutine builders like `runBlocking`, `launch`, or `async` within a coroutine scope.

17. **What is structured concurrency and how does it relate to suspending functions?**
    > Structured concurrency is a principle that ensures that when a coroutine is cancelled, all its child coroutines are cancelled too. Suspending functions play a crucial role in structured concurrency by allowing coroutines to be organized hierarchically and managed together.

18. **How does the `withContext` function relate to suspending functions?**
    > `withContext` is a suspending function that allows you to switch the context of a coroutine. It's often used to change the dispatcher (e.g., to perform I/O operations on an I/O dispatcher) while still writing sequential code.

19. **What is the purpose of the `suspendCoroutine` function?**
    > `suspendCoroutine` is used to convert callback-based APIs to suspend functions. It provides direct access to the continuation of a coroutine, allowing you to resume the coroutine manually when an asynchronous operation completes.

20. **How do suspending functions interact with coroutine scopes?**
    > Suspending functions can be called within a coroutine scope. They inherit the context of the coroutine that calls them, including the scope's job and dispatcher. This allows for proper structuring and cancellation of coroutines.

## 🎓 Hard Questions

21. **How does the Kotlin compiler transform suspending functions under the hood?**
    > The Kotlin compiler transforms suspending functions into state machines. Each suspension point becomes a state, and the function's local variables are stored in a generated class. The compiler also creates a continuation object that keeps track of the current state and allows the function to resume from where it left off.

22. **What is the purpose of the `suspendCancellableCoroutine` function and how does it differ from `suspendCoroutine`?**
    > `suspendCancellableCoroutine` is similar to `suspendCoroutine`, but it also handles cancellation. It provides a `CancellableContinuation` object that can be used to resume the coroutine or cancel it. This is useful when working with APIs that support cancellation, allowing you to properly cancel the operation if the coroutine is cancelled.

23. **How can you implement your own coroutine builder using suspending functions?**
    > To implement a custom coroutine builder, you need to use the `startCoroutine` extension function on suspending lambdas. This function takes a continuation as an argument. You'll need to create a custom continuation that defines how the coroutine should be started and how its result should be handled.

24. **What are the implications of using suspending functions in interface methods?**
    > When you declare a suspending function in an interface, all implementing classes must also mark that method as suspending. This can lead to a "suspension contagion" where the suspending nature of a function propagates through the codebase. It's important to carefully consider whether an interface method should be suspending, as it affects how the interface can be used and implemented.

25. **How does the `select` expression work with suspending functions, and what are its use cases?**
    > The `select` expression allows you to await multiple suspending operations simultaneously and proceed with the first one that becomes available. It's useful for scenarios like implementing timeouts, racing multiple operations, or handling multiple potential inputs. `select` works by starting all the provided suspending functions concurrently and resuming the coroutine with the result of the first one that completes.

26. **What is a suspending lambda, and how does it differ from a regular lambda?**
    > A suspending lambda is a lambda expression that can contain suspending function calls. It has the function type `suspend () -> T` (where T is the return type). Unlike regular lambdas, suspending lambdas can only be invoked from within a coroutine or another suspending function. They allow for the creation of reusable blocks of suspendable code.

27. **How can you use suspending functions to implement cooperative cancellation in long-running operations?**
    > To implement cooperative cancellation, you should periodically check the `isActive` flag of the current coroutine or call the `yield()` function. This allows the coroutine to be cancelled at these check points. For CPU-intensive operations, you can create your own cancellable suspending functions that check for cancellation and throw a `CancellationException` when cancelled.

28. **What are the challenges and best practices when unit testing suspending functions?**
    > Testing suspending functions can be challenging because they need to run within a coroutine. Best practices include:
    > - Using `runBlocking` or `runTest` to create a test coroutine scope.
    > - Using `TestDispatcher` to control the virtual time in tests.
    > - Leveraging the `kotlinx-coroutines-test` library for advanced testing scenarios.
    > - Creating test doubles for suspending functions that simulate different timings and outcomes.
    > - Testing both successful scenarios and error handling, including cancellation.

29. **How can you use suspending functions to implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff?**
    > To implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff, you can create a suspending function that uses a loop to retry the operation. After each failed attempt, use `delay()` with an exponentially increasing duration. You can also add jitter to the delay to prevent multiple retries from synchronizing. The function should also respect cancellation and allow for a maximum number of retries or a timeout.

30. **What are the performance implications of using many short-lived suspending functions versus fewer long-running ones?**
    > Using many short-lived suspending functions can lead to more frequent context switches and higher overhead due to the creation and management of multiple coroutines. However, it can also lead to more responsive code and better utilization of system resources. On the other hand, fewer long-running suspending functions might have less overhead but could potentially block other coroutines from running. The best approach depends on the specific use case and should be determined through profiling and performance testing.
