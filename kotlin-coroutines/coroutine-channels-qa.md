## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **What is a Channel in Kotlin Coroutines?**
   > A Channel is a communication primitive that allows you to transfer a stream of values between coroutines. It's conceptually similar to BlockingQueue.

2. **How do you create a Channel?**
   > You can create a Channel using the Channel() factory function, e.g., `val channel = Channel<Int>()`.

3. **What are the basic operations on a Channel?**
   > The basic operations are send() to send an element to the channel, and receive() to receive an element from the channel.

4. **What happens if you try to receive from an empty Channel?**
   > If you try to receive from an empty Channel, the coroutine will suspend until an element becomes available.

5. **How do you close a Channel?**
   > You can close a Channel by calling the close() method on it.

6. **What is the difference between send() and offer() methods?**
   > send() is a suspending function that waits if the channel is full, while offer() is a non-suspending function that immediately returns false if the channel is full.

7. **How can you iterate over the elements of a Channel?**
   > You can use a for loop to iterate over the elements of a Channel, e.g., `for (item in channel) { ... }`.

8. **What happens when you try to send to a closed Channel?**
   > Sending to a closed Channel throws a ClosedSendChannelException.

9. **What is a produce coroutine builder?**
   > produce is a coroutine builder that creates a coroutine that sends elements to a Channel.

10. **How do you create an unlimited Channel?**
    > You can create an unlimited Channel using `Channel(UNLIMITED)`.

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **What are the different Channel types in Kotlin Coroutines?**
    > The main Channel types are: RENDEZVOUS, CONFLATED, UNLIMITED, and BUFFERED. Each has different behavior regarding buffering and suspending.

12. **How does a RENDEZVOUS Channel work?**
    > A RENDEZVOUS Channel (created with Channel(0)) has no buffer. The sender suspends until a receiver is ready to receive, and vice versa.

13. **What is the purpose of a CONFLATED Channel?**
    > A CONFLATED Channel keeps only the last sent element, overwriting previous ones. It's useful when you only need the most recent value.

14. **How can you use select with Channels?**
    > The select statement allows you to wait on multiple channel operations simultaneously and proceed with the first one that becomes available.

15. **What is the difference between Channel and BroadcastChannel?**
    > A regular Channel delivers each element to only one receiver, while a BroadcastChannel can have multiple receivers, each receiving all elements.

16. **How do you handle exceptions when working with Channels?**
    > You can use try-catch blocks around send and receive operations. For produce builders, exceptions are propagated to the consumer.

17. **What is the purpose of the consumeEach function?**
    > consumeEach is a convenience function that receives all elements from a Channel and performs a given action on each. It automatically closes the Channel when done.

18. **How can you implement a pipeline using Channels?**
    > You can implement a pipeline by chaining multiple coroutines, where each coroutine receives from one Channel and sends to another.

19. **What is a fan-out pattern, and how can you implement it with Channels?**
    > Fan-out is when multiple coroutines receive from the same Channel. You can implement it by having multiple coroutines call receive() on the same Channel.

20. **What is a fan-in pattern, and how can you implement it with Channels?**
    > Fan-in is when multiple coroutines send to the same Channel. You can implement it by having multiple coroutines call send() on the same Channel.

## 🎓 Hard Questions

21. **How would you implement a bounded producer-consumer pattern using Channels?**
    > To implement a bounded producer-consumer pattern:
    > - Create a Channel with a fixed buffer size
    > - Launch producer coroutines that send to the Channel
    > - Launch consumer coroutines that receive from the Channel
    > - Use a supervisor scope to manage the coroutines
    > - Implement proper exception handling and cancellation

22. **What are the trade-offs between using Channels and using Flows in Kotlin Coroutines?**
    > Trade-offs include:
    > - Channels are hot, Flows are cold
    > - Channels support multiple producers and consumers, Flows typically have a single producer
    > - Channels have built-in backpressure handling, Flows require explicit backpressure handling
    > - Flows are more composable and offer more operators
    > - Channels are better for communication between coroutines, Flows are better for reactive streams

23. **How would you implement a priority Channel where elements are received based on their priority?**
    > Implementation approach:
    > - Create a custom Channel class that wraps a PriorityQueue
    > - Override send() to insert elements into the PriorityQueue based on their priority
    > - Override receive() to remove and return the highest priority element
    > - Implement proper synchronization to ensure thread-safety
    > - Handle cancellation and closing of the Channel

24. **How can you implement a timeout for Channel operations without using withTimeout?**
    > Implementation approach:
    > - Use select with a timeout channel
    > - Create a channel that sends a unit value after a delay
    > - In the select, include cases for both the main channel operation and the timeout channel
    > - If the timeout channel wins the select, throw a custom timeout exception or handle it as needed

25. **How would you design a system using Channels to manage rate limiting in a distributed environment?**
    > Design considerations:
    > - Use a Channel to represent the rate limit tokens
    > - Implement a coroutine that periodically adds tokens to the Channel
    > - Distributed services consume tokens from the Channel before performing rate-limited operations
    > - Use a distributed cache or database to share the Channel state across nodes
    > - Implement proper error handling for network issues and node failures
    > - Consider using a leaky bucket or token bucket algorithm for more advanced rate limiting

26. **How would you implement a custom Channel that supports transactional sends and receives?**
    > Implementation approach:
    > - Create a custom Channel class that wraps a regular Channel
    > - Implement a transaction object that can hold multiple send/receive operations
    > - Override send() and receive() to add operations to the current transaction
    > - Implement commit() and rollback() methods for transactions
    > - Use locks or atomics to ensure thread-safety and consistency
    > - Handle edge cases like cancellation during a transaction

27. **What are the challenges and solutions for implementing a distributed work queue using Channels?**
    > Challenges and solutions:
    > - Ensuring exactly-once processing: Use acknowledgments and idempotent operations
    > - Handling node failures: Implement a heartbeat mechanism and work reassignment
    > - Scalability: Use multiple Channels and load balancing
    > - Persistence: Integrate with a durable storage system for fault tolerance
    > - Monitoring and debugging: Implement comprehensive logging and tracing
    > - Handling backpressure: Implement throttling mechanisms and overflow policies

28. **How can you implement a custom Channel that supports sliding window operations?**
    > Implementation approach:
    > - Create a custom Channel class that maintains a fixed-size buffer
    > - Implement a sliding window algorithm in the send() method
    > - Override receive() to return window snapshots
    > - Implement efficient data structures for the window (e.g., circular buffer)
    > - Handle edge cases like window size changes and Channel closure
    > - Ensure thread-safety for concurrent operations

29. **What are the best practices for using Channels in a large-scale, multi-module Android application?**
    > Best practices include:
    > - Use dependency injection to provide Channels where needed
    > - Implement proper lifecycle management to avoid leaks
    > - Use structured concurrency principles
    > - Consider using Flows for UI-related streams
    > - Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
    > - Use appropriate Channel types based on the use case (e.g., CONFLATED for UI updates)
    > - Avoid sharing Channels across module boundaries; use abstraction layers
    > - Implement proper testing strategies for Channel-based components

30. **How would you design a publish-subscribe system using Channels that supports dynamic subscriptions and message replay?**
    > Design considerations:
    > - Use a main publish Channel for incoming messages
    > - Maintain a map of topic to list of subscriber Channels
    > - Implement a coroutine that fans out messages from the main Channel to subscriber Channels
    > - Use a concurrent-safe data structure for managing subscriptions
    > - Implement a message store for replay functionality
    > - Use a BUFFERED Channel with a large capacity for the main publish Channel
    > - Implement backpressure handling for slow subscribers
