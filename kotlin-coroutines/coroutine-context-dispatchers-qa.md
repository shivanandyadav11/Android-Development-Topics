## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **What is a CoroutineContext in Kotlin?**
   > A CoroutineContext is a set of elements that define the behavior of a coroutine. It includes things like the Job of the coroutine, its dispatcher, name, and other user-defined elements.

2. **What is a Coroutine Dispatcher?**
   > A Coroutine Dispatcher determines which thread or threads the coroutine uses for its execution. It controls when and where the execution of coroutine code takes place.

3. **What are the main types of dispatchers provided by Kotlin coroutines?**
   > The main types are Dispatchers.Default (for CPU-intensive tasks), Dispatchers.IO (for I/O operations), Dispatchers.Main (for UI-related tasks in Android), and Dispatchers.Unconfined.

4. **How do you specify a dispatcher when launching a coroutine?**
   > You can specify a dispatcher by passing it as a parameter to the coroutine builder, e.g., `launch(Dispatchers.IO) { ... }`.

5. **What is the purpose of Dispatchers.Default?**
   > Dispatchers.Default is used for CPU-intensive tasks. It uses a shared thread pool that's limited to the number of CPU cores available.

6. **What is the purpose of Dispatchers.IO?**
   > Dispatchers.IO is optimized for offloading blocking I/O tasks to a shared pool of threads.

7. **What is Dispatchers.Main used for?**
   > Dispatchers.Main is used for UI-related tasks, particularly in Android development. It runs coroutines on the main (UI) thread.

8. **What happens if you don't specify a dispatcher when launching a coroutine?**
   > If you don't specify a dispatcher, the coroutine inherits the context (including the dispatcher) from its parent coroutine or scope.

9. **Can you change the dispatcher of a running coroutine?**
   > While you can't change the dispatcher of a running coroutine directly, you can use `withContext()` to switch to a different dispatcher for a specific block of code.

10. **What is a CoroutineScope?**
    > A CoroutineScope defines the lifecycle of coroutines. It's used to group related coroutines together and manage their lifecycle as a unit.

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **How does CoroutineContext composition work?**
    > CoroutineContext composition allows you to combine multiple context elements. When you add two contexts, the elements from the right-hand context override elements with the same key from the left-hand context.

12. **What is the difference between Dispatchers.Default and Dispatchers.IO?**
    > While both use a shared thread pool, Dispatchers.Default is limited to the number of CPU cores, whereas Dispatchers.IO can create additional threads as needed for blocking I/O operations.

13. **How does Dispatchers.Unconfined work and when should it be used?**
    > Dispatchers.Unconfined doesn't switch the thread unless the coroutine suspends. It resumes in the thread that completed the suspending function. It should be used with caution, mainly for unit tests or when thread-locality isn't required.

14. **What is the purpose of newSingleThreadContext?**
    > newSingleThreadContext creates a new coroutine dispatcher that uses a dedicated thread for executing coroutines. It's useful when you need to ensure that certain operations always run on the same thread.

15. **How can you create a custom dispatcher?**
    > You can create a custom dispatcher by implementing the CoroutineDispatcher abstract class and overriding its dispatch method. This allows you to control how and where coroutines are executed.

16. **What is the relationship between Job and CoroutineContext?**
    > Job is an element of CoroutineContext. It represents the lifecycle of the coroutine and can be used to cancel the coroutine or wait for its completion.

17. **How does coroutine naming work in the context?**
    > You can name a coroutine using the CoroutineName context element. This name is useful for debugging and logging purposes.

18. **What is the purpose of the withContext function?**
    > withContext allows you to temporarily change the context of a coroutine for a specific block of code. It's commonly used to switch dispatchers or add additional context elements.

19. **How does exception handling relate to coroutine context?**
    > The CoroutineExceptionHandler is a context element that can be used to catch and handle uncaught exceptions in coroutines.

20. **What is the difference between launch and async in terms of context inheritance?**
    > Both launch and async inherit the context from their parent scope, but async additionally adds a new Job to the context to represent its deferred result.

</details>

## 🎓 Hard Questions

21. **How does the Kotlin coroutine framework decide which dispatcher to use when multiple contexts are involved?**
    > When multiple contexts are involved, the Kotlin coroutine framework uses a specific order of precedence. The dispatcher specified directly in the coroutine builder takes highest precedence, followed by the dispatcher in the scope, and then any parent contexts.

22. **What are the implications of using withContext vs creating a new coroutine with a different dispatcher?**
    > Using withContext switches the context for a block of code within the same coroutine, which is more efficient than creating a new coroutine. However, creating a new coroutine allows for more parallel execution if needed.

23. **How can you implement a custom ExecutorCoroutineDispatcher?**
    > To implement a custom ExecutorCoroutineDispatcher, you need to extend the ExecutorCoroutineDispatcher class and provide an Executor implementation. This allows you to create a dispatcher with custom thread management behavior.

24. **What is the relationship between ThreadLocal and coroutine contexts?**
    > ThreadLocal values are not automatically propagated to new threads when coroutines switch dispatchers. To achieve similar functionality, you can use the ThreadContextElement to create context-local values that are preserved across coroutine suspensions and dispatcher switches.

25. **How does the coroutine context affect structured concurrency?**
    > The coroutine context plays a crucial role in structured concurrency. It ensures that child coroutines inherit properties from their parents, allows for proper cancellation propagation, and helps maintain the hierarchical structure of coroutines.

26. **What are the performance implications of frequently switching dispatchers?**
    > Frequently switching dispatchers can introduce overhead due to context switching and potential thread creation. It's generally more efficient to design your coroutines to minimize dispatcher switches, using withContext only when necessary.

27. **How can you implement a priority-based dispatcher?**
    > To implement a priority-based dispatcher, you can create a custom CoroutineDispatcher that uses a priority queue to manage runnable coroutines. The dispatch method would then execute coroutines based on their priority.

28. **What is the purpose of the yield function in relation to dispatchers?**
    > The yield function allows a coroutine to suspend itself, giving other coroutines a chance to run. This can be particularly useful with the Unconfined dispatcher to ensure fair execution among coroutines.

29. **How does the coroutine context interact with Flow collectors?**
    > The context of a Flow collector can affect how the Flow is collected. The flowOn operator can be used to change the context of the upstream Flow, while the context of the collector itself determines where the downstream operations are executed.

30. **What are the best practices for managing dispatchers in a large-scale application?**
    > Best practices include:
    > - Using a dependency injection framework to provide and manage dispatchers
    > - Creating custom dispatchers for specific use cases when necessary
    > - Avoiding the overuse of withContext by designing coroutines to run primarily on a single dispatcher
    > - Using structured concurrency principles to ensure proper cancellation and error handling
    > - Monitoring and optimizing dispatcher usage based on application performance metrics
