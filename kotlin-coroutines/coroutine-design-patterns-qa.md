## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **What is a coroutine design pattern?**
   > A coroutine design pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem in coroutine-based concurrent programming.

2. **What is the Producer-Consumer pattern in coroutines?**
   > The Producer-Consumer pattern involves one or more coroutines producing data and one or more coroutines consuming that data, often using a shared data structure like a Channel.

3. **What is the purpose of the supervisor pattern in coroutines?**
   > The supervisor pattern allows child coroutines to fail independently without affecting their siblings or the parent coroutine.

4. **What is the Fire-and-Forget pattern in coroutines?**
   > Fire-and-Forget is a pattern where a coroutine is launched without waiting for its result, typically used for operations that don't need to return a value or be tracked.

5. **What is the purpose of the Cancellable pattern in coroutines?**
   > The Cancellable pattern ensures that a coroutine can be safely and cooperatively cancelled at certain points in its execution.

6. **What is the Sequential pattern in coroutines?**
   > The Sequential pattern involves executing a series of asynchronous operations one after another, typically using suspend functions.

7. **What is the Parallel Decomposition pattern?**
   > Parallel Decomposition involves breaking a task into smaller subtasks that can be executed concurrently using coroutines.

8. **What is the purpose of the Timeout pattern in coroutines?**
   > The Timeout pattern ensures that an operation completes within a specified time limit, cancelling it if it exceeds that limit.

9. **What is the Fan-Out pattern in coroutines?**
   > The Fan-Out pattern involves distributing work from a single source to multiple coroutines for parallel processing.

10. **What is the purpose of the Buffering pattern in coroutines?**
    > The Buffering pattern uses a buffer to store produced items, allowing the producer to continue generating items even if the consumer is not immediately ready to process them.

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **How does the Actor pattern work in the context of coroutines?**
    > The Actor pattern in coroutines involves creating an isolated entity (actor) that processes messages sequentially from its own private Channel, ensuring thread-safe state manipulation.

12. **What is the Mutex pattern, and when is it useful in coroutines?**
    > The Mutex pattern provides mutual exclusion, allowing only one coroutine at a time to execute a critical section of code. It's useful for protecting shared mutable state.

13. **How does the Pipeline pattern work with coroutines?**
    > The Pipeline pattern involves chaining multiple processing stages, where each stage is a coroutine that receives data from the previous stage, processes it, and sends it to the next stage.

14. **What is the purpose of the Throttling pattern in coroutines?**
    > The Throttling pattern limits the rate at which certain operations are performed, often used to prevent overload of resources or to comply with rate limits.

15. **How does the Pooling pattern work with coroutines?**
    > The Pooling pattern involves maintaining a pool of reusable resources (e.g., connections, objects) that can be acquired and released by coroutines as needed, improving efficiency.

16. **What is the Barrier pattern in coroutines?**
    > The Barrier pattern synchronizes multiple coroutines at a specific point, ensuring that all coroutines reach that point before any of them proceed further.

17. **How does the Debounce pattern work with coroutines?**
    > The Debounce pattern delays the processing of a rapidly occurring event until a certain amount of time has passed without another occurrence of the event.

18. **What is the purpose of the Bulkheading pattern in coroutines?**
    > The Bulkheading pattern isolates different parts of an application into separate coroutine scopes, preventing failures in one part from affecting others.

19. **How does the Retry pattern work with coroutines?**
    > The Retry pattern automatically retries a failed operation a certain number of times or until successful, often with a delay between attempts.

20. **What is the Publish-Subscribe pattern in the context of coroutines?**
    > The Publish-Subscribe pattern involves publishers emitting values to multiple subscribers, often implemented using Flows or Channels in coroutines.
