## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **Why are coroutines particularly useful in Android development?**
   > Coroutines help manage long-running tasks efficiently without blocking the main thread, improving app responsiveness and simplifying asynchronous code.

2. **What is the main thread in Android, and why is it important?**
   > The main thread handles UI operations and user interactions. It's crucial not to block this thread to maintain a responsive app.

3. **How do you start a coroutine in an Android app?**
   > You can start a coroutine using `lifecycleScope.launch {}` in activities and fragments, or `viewModelScope.launch {}` in ViewModels.

4. **What is lifecycleScope in Android?**
   > `lifecycleScope` is a coroutine scope tied to the lifecycle of an Activity or Fragment, automatically cancelling coroutines when the lifecycle is destroyed.

5. **How do coroutines help prevent ANRs (Application Not Responding) in Android?**
   > Coroutines allow long-running operations to be performed off the main thread without complex threading code, reducing the risk of blocking the UI and causing ANRs.

6. **What is the purpose of Dispatchers.Main in Android coroutines?**
   > Dispatchers.Main is used to run coroutines on the Android main thread, which is necessary for UI operations.

7. **How do you perform a network request using coroutines in Android?**
   > You can use a suspend function with a library like Retrofit, wrapping the network call in `withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {}` to ensure it runs off the main thread.

8. **What is viewModelScope in Android?**
   > `viewModelScope` is a coroutine scope tied to a ViewModel, automatically cancelling coroutines when the ViewModel is cleared.

9. **How do you update the UI from a coroutine in Android?**
   > You can update the UI directly from a coroutine running on Dispatchers.Main, or use `withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {}` to switch to the main thread.

10. **What is the advantage of using coroutines over AsyncTask in Android?**
    > Coroutines are more flexible, easier to read and write, and provide better control over concurrency compared to AsyncTask, which is now deprecated.

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **How does structured concurrency in coroutines benefit Android app architecture?**
    > Structured concurrency ensures that when a particular screen or component is destroyed, all its associated coroutines are automatically cancelled, preventing memory leaks and unnecessary work.

12. **What is the role of CoroutineScope in Android development?**
    > CoroutineScope defines a lifecycle for coroutines. In Android, custom scopes can be created to manage coroutines for specific components or features, ensuring proper cancellation and resource management.

13. **How can you handle configuration changes (like screen rotation) when using coroutines in Android?**
    > By using ViewModel and viewModelScope, coroutines can survive configuration changes. For long-running operations, you might use WorkManager with coroutines.

14. **What is the purpose of the `launch` extension function on LiveData?**
    > The `launch` extension function on LiveData, provided by the lifecycle-livedata-ktx library, allows you to start a coroutine that automatically updates the LiveData value when completed.

15. **How do you test coroutines in Android applications?**
    > You can use libraries like `kotlinx-coroutines-test` to provide a TestCoroutineDispatcher, allowing you to control the execution of coroutines in tests. JUnit rules can also be used to manage the main dispatcher in tests.

16. **How can you implement a retry mechanism for network requests using coroutines in Android?**
    > You can use a loop with a try-catch block inside a coroutine, implementing exponential backoff for retries. Libraries like Retrofit also provide built-in support for retries with coroutines.

17. **What is the difference between `GlobalScope` and `lifecycleScope` in Android, and when should each be used?**
    > `GlobalScope` launches coroutines that live for the entire app lifecycle, while `lifecycleScope` is bound to a specific lifecycle component. Generally, `lifecycleScope` is preferred to prevent leaks and unnecessary work.

18. **How can you use coroutines with Room database operations in Android?**
    > Room supports suspend functions for database operations. You can define your DAO methods as suspend functions and call them from coroutines, typically using Dispatchers.IO for the database operations.

19. **What is the purpose of `flow` in Android development, and how does it relate to coroutines?**
    > `flow` is used for handling streams of data asynchronously. It's built on top of coroutines and is useful for scenarios like real-time updates or continuous data processing in Android apps.

20. **How can you handle multiple concurrent network requests using coroutines in Android?**
    > You can use `async` to start multiple concurrent requests and `await` to wait for their results. For example: 
    ```kotlin
    val result1 = async { api.getDataOne() }
    val result2 = async { api.getDataTwo() }
    val combinedResult = result1.await() + result2.await()
    ```
