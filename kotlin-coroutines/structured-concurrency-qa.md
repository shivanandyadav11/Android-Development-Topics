## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **What is structured concurrency in Kotlin coroutines?**
   > Structured concurrency is a programming paradigm that ensures that all child coroutines complete before the parent coroutine completes, providing better control over the lifecycle of concurrent operations.

2. **What is the main benefit of structured concurrency?**
   > The main benefit is preventing leaks of coroutines and ensuring proper cancellation of all child coroutines when the parent scope is cancelled.

3. **What is a coroutine scope?**
   > A coroutine scope is a context that defines the lifetime of a set of coroutines. It manages the lifecycle of all coroutines launched within it.

4. **How do you create a new coroutine scope?**
   > You can create a new coroutine scope using the `coroutineScope` function or by instantiating `CoroutineScope` directly.

5. **What happens to child coroutines when a parent coroutine is cancelled?**
   > When a parent coroutine is cancelled, all its child coroutines are automatically cancelled as well.

6. **What is the purpose of the `launch` coroutine builder?**
   > `launch` is used to start a new coroutine without blocking the current thread and returns a `Job` representing the coroutine.

7. **How does `async` differ from `launch` in terms of structured concurrency?**
   > While both `async` and `launch` create child coroutines, `async` returns a `Deferred` that can be used to retrieve the result of the coroutine.

8. **What is a Job in the context of structured concurrency?**
   > A Job is a cancellable entity with a lifecycle that represents the state of a coroutine and its children.

9. **How does `supervisorScope` relate to structured concurrency?**
   > `supervisorScope` creates a scope where failures of children don't affect the parent or siblings, allowing for more flexible error handling within structured concurrency.

10. **What is the difference between `coroutineScope` and `CoroutineScope`?**
    > `coroutineScope` is a suspending function that creates a new scope and waits for all children to complete, while `CoroutineScope` is an interface for creating custom scopes.

</details>

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **How does structured concurrency help with resource management?**
    > Structured concurrency ensures that resources are properly released when coroutines complete or are cancelled, preventing resource leaks and simplifying cleanup operations.

12. **What is the relationship between structured concurrency and exception handling?**
    > In structured concurrency, exceptions in child coroutines are propagated to their parent, allowing for centralized error handling and ensuring that no errors are silently lost.

13. **How can you implement a timeout for a group of coroutines using structured concurrency?**
    > You can use the `withTimeout` function to create a scope that automatically cancels all child coroutines if the specified timeout is exceeded.

14. **What is the purpose of the `coroutineScope` function in structured concurrency?**
    > `coroutineScope` creates a new coroutine scope and suspends the current coroutine until all launched children complete, ensuring structured concurrency.

15. **How does structured concurrency affect the use of global coroutine scopes?**
    > Structured concurrency discourages the use of global scopes (like `GlobalScope`) because they don't provide the lifecycle management and cancellation benefits of structured concurrency.

16. **What is the difference between `runBlocking` and `coroutineScope` in terms of structured concurrency?**
    > `runBlocking` blocks the current thread and creates a coroutine scope, while `coroutineScope` suspends the current coroutine without blocking the thread. Both ensure all child coroutines complete before returning.

17. **How can you use structured concurrency to implement a cancellable asynchronous operation?**
    > You can launch the operation in a new coroutine scope, which allows you to cancel the entire operation and its child coroutines by cancelling the parent scope.

18. **What is the role of `Job` hierarchy in structured concurrency?**
    > The `Job` hierarchy represents the parent-child relationships between coroutines, facilitating structured cancellation and completion of coroutines.

19. **How does structured concurrency help with avoiding race conditions?**
    > By providing clear scopes and lifecycles for concurrent operations, structured concurrency makes it easier to reason about and control the execution order and shared state access of coroutines.

20. **What are the benefits of using `supervisorScope` in structured concurrency?**
    > `supervisorScope` allows child coroutines to fail independently without affecting siblings or the parent, providing more flexibility in error handling while still maintaining the benefits of structured concurrency.
