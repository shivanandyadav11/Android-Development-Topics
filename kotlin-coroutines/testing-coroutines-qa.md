## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **What is the purpose of testing coroutines?**
   > Testing coroutines ensures that asynchronous code behaves correctly, handles concurrency issues properly, and manages resources efficiently.

2. **What is the kotlinx-coroutines-test library?**
   > It's a library that provides utilities for testing coroutines, including TestCoroutineDispatcher and runBlockingTest.

3. **What is a TestCoroutineDispatcher?**
   > TestCoroutineDispatcher is a special dispatcher that allows you to control the virtual time in coroutine tests, making it easier to test time-dependent scenarios.

4. **How do you use runBlockingTest in coroutine tests?**
   > runBlockingTest is a test function that creates a test coroutine scope and allows you to control the virtual time of coroutines within that scope.

5. **What is the difference between runBlocking and runBlockingTest?**
   > runBlocking actually blocks the thread, while runBlockingTest uses a TestCoroutineDispatcher to control virtual time without blocking the thread.

6. **How do you test a suspend function?**
   > You can test a suspend function by calling it within a runBlockingTest block or by using a TestCoroutineScope.

7. **What is a TestCoroutineScope?**
   > TestCoroutineScope is a coroutine scope that uses TestCoroutineDispatcher, allowing you to control the execution of coroutines in tests.

8. **How do you advance time in a coroutine test?**
   > You can advance time in a coroutine test using methods like advanceTimeBy() or advanceUntilIdle() on the TestCoroutineDispatcher.

9. **What is the purpose of the pauseDispatcher() function in testing?**
   > pauseDispatcher() pauses the execution of the TestCoroutineDispatcher, allowing you to control when coroutines resume execution.

10. **How do you test exception handling in coroutines?**
    > You can use assertThrows or try-catch blocks within a runBlockingTest to verify that the correct exceptions are thrown.

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **How do you test a Flow in Kotlin coroutines?**
    > You can test a Flow using the TestCoroutineScope and collecting the Flow's values. Libraries like Turbine can also be helpful for testing Flows.

12. **What is the purpose of the Dispatchers.setMain() function in Android testing?**
    > Dispatchers.setMain() allows you to set a custom dispatcher (usually a TestCoroutineDispatcher) as the Main dispatcher for Android tests, enabling controlled testing of UI-related coroutines.

13. **How do you test a coroutine that uses withContext to switch dispatchers?**
    > You can use a TestCoroutineDispatcher and set it as the Main dispatcher. This allows you to control the execution of coroutines regardless of the dispatcher they use.

14. **What is the difference between eager and lazy coroutine execution in tests?**
    > Eager execution runs coroutines immediately when launched, while lazy execution requires you to manually advance time or call runCurrent(). TestCoroutineDispatcher uses lazy execution by default.

15. **How do you test a coroutine that uses delay()?**
    > When using TestCoroutineDispatcher, you can advance the virtual time using advanceTimeBy() or advanceUntilIdle() to simulate the delay without actually waiting.

16. **How do you test a coroutine that uses a timeout?**
    > You can use advanceTimeBy() to simulate the passage of time and test both scenarios where the timeout is reached and where it isn't.

17. **What is the purpose of the runTest function introduced in kotlinx-coroutines-test 1.6.0?**
    > runTest is an improved version of runBlockingTest that provides better support for testing suspend functions and offers more precise control over the test coroutine scope.

18. **How do you test a coroutine that uses supervisorScope?**
    > You can create a TestCoroutineScope with a SupervisorJob and use it to launch your coroutines. This allows you to test the behavior of coroutines within a supervisor scope.

19. **What is the purpose of the UnconfinedTestDispatcher?**
    > UnconfinedTestDispatcher is a dispatcher that immediately executes coroutines, which can be useful for testing scenarios where you want tasks to complete eagerly.

20. **How do you test a coroutine that uses a Channel?**
    > You can use a TestCoroutineScope to launch coroutines that send to and receive from the Channel. You can then use assertions to verify the correct values are sent and received.

## 🎓 Hard Questions

21. **How would you implement a custom test dispatcher that simulates network latency?**
    > Implementation approach:
    > - Create a custom CoroutineDispatcher class
