## 🌱 Easy Questions

1. **How does exception handling in coroutines differ from regular try-catch blocks?**
   > While you can use try-catch blocks in coroutines, coroutines also provide additional mechanisms for handling exceptions across asynchronous operations.

2. **What is a CoroutineExceptionHandler?**
   > A CoroutineExceptionHandler is a coroutine context element used to handle uncaught exceptions in coroutines.

3. **How do you create a CoroutineExceptionHandler?**
   > You can create a CoroutineExceptionHandler using the CoroutineExceptionHandler constructor and providing a lambda that handles the exception.

4. **Can exceptions in coroutines be propagated to the parent coroutine?**
   > Yes, by default, exceptions in child coroutines are propagated to their parent coroutine.

5. **What happens if an exception is not caught in a coroutine?**
   > If an exception is not caught in a coroutine, it propagates to the parent coroutine. If it reaches the top level, it is handled by the uncaught exception handler.

6. **How do you use try-catch in a coroutine?**
   > You can use try-catch blocks in coroutines just like in regular Kotlin code. It's useful for handling exceptions within a specific coroutine.

7. **What is the difference in exception handling between launch and async?**
   > In launch, exceptions are thrown immediately. In async, exceptions are deferred until the result is awaited.

8. **Can you use multiple try-catch blocks in a coroutine?**
   > Yes, you can use multiple try-catch blocks in a coroutine, just like in regular Kotlin code.

9. **What happens if an exception occurs in a suspended function?**
   > If an exception occurs in a suspended function, it is propagated to the coroutine that called the function.

10. **Can you rethrow exceptions in coroutines?**
    > Yes, you can rethrow exceptions in coroutines using the throw keyword, just like in regular Kotlin code.

## 🏋️ Medium Questions

11. **How does supervisorScope affect exception handling?**
    > supervisorScope allows child coroutines to fail independently without cancelling other children or the parent. The parent is responsible for handling exceptions of its children.

12. **What is the difference between coroutineScope and supervisorScope in terms of exception handling?**
    > In coroutineScope, an exception in any child cancels all other children and the scope itself. In supervisorScope, children can fail independently without affecting siblings or the parent.

13. **How can you handle exceptions in async coroutines?**
    > Exceptions in async coroutines are stored in the resulting Deferred object and are thrown when await() is called. You can use try-catch around the await() call to handle these exceptions.

14. **What is the purpose of the SupervisorJob in exception handling?**
    > SupervisorJob is used to create a scope where the failure of a child does not affect its siblings. It's often used in conjunction with supervisorScope.

15. **How does cancellation relate to exception handling in coroutines?**
    > Cancellation in coroutines is closely related to exception handling. When a coroutine is cancelled, it throws a CancellationException, which can be caught and handled like other exceptions.

16. **What happens if multiple child coroutines throw exceptions?**
    > In a regular coroutineScope, the first exception cancels all other children and is propagated. In a supervisorScope, each exception is handled independently.

17. **How can you propagate exceptions across different coroutine scopes?**
    > You can use coroutineScope to create a new scope that will propagate exceptions to its parent. Alternatively, you can manually catch and re-throw exceptions across scopes.

18. **What is the role of CoroutineExceptionHandler in structured concurrency?**
    > CoroutineExceptionHandler is used to catch uncaught exceptions in the coroutine hierarchy. It's typically set at the top level of a coroutine hierarchy to handle any unhandled exceptions.

19. **How does withContext affect exception propagation?**
    > withContext creates a new coroutine with a new job, but exceptions are still propagated to the parent coroutine. The exception will be rethrown in the calling coroutine.

20. **What happens if an exception is thrown in a coroutine launched with GlobalScope?**
    > Exceptions in GlobalScope coroutines are not propagated to any parent and will be handled by the default uncaught exception handler, which typically crashes the application.

## 🎓 Hard Questions

21. **How would you implement a custom exception handling strategy for a complex coroutine hierarchy?**
    > A custom strategy could involve:
    > - Using supervisorScope at appropriate levels to isolate failures
    > - Implementing custom CoroutineExceptionHandlers for different parts of the hierarchy
    > - Using channels or shared state to communicate exceptions across the hierarchy
    > - Implementing retry mechanisms for recoverable errors
    > - Logging and reporting mechanisms for different types of exceptions

22. **What are the implications of using try-catch versus CoroutineExceptionHandler in terms of coroutine cancellation?**
    > try-catch blocks within a coroutine don't prevent the coroutine from being cancelled. CoroutineExceptionHandler, on the other hand, is only invoked for uncaught exceptions and doesn't prevent cancellation. However, CoroutineExceptionHandler can be used to perform cleanup or logging actions when a coroutine hierarchy fails.

23. **How can you implement a "circuit breaker" pattern using coroutines and exception handling?**
    > A circuit breaker could be implemented using:
    > - A shared state to track failure count and circuit status
    > - Coroutines to perform the actual operations
    > - Exception handling to detect failures and update the circuit status
    > - Timeouts to automatically reset the circuit after a certain period
    > - Supervisors to isolate failures and prevent them from affecting the entire system

24. **What are the challenges in handling exceptions in a system with multiple layers of nested coroutine scopes?**
    > Challenges include:
    > - Ensuring exceptions are caught at the right level
    > - Preventing unintended cancellation of unrelated coroutines
    > - Maintaining clear exception propagation paths
    > - Avoiding redundant error handling
    > - Ensuring proper cleanup of resources across multiple layers
    > - Balancing between failing fast and providing resilience

25. **How would you design an exception handling system for a library that uses coroutines internally but is used by non-coroutine code?**
    > Considerations for such a system include:
    > - Providing clear API contracts for how exceptions are handled and propagated
    > - Using supervisorScope to prevent internal failures from affecting the entire library
    > - Implementing a custom exception translator to convert coroutine-specific exceptions into domain-specific exceptions
    > - Offering both synchronous and asynchronous APIs with consistent exception handling behavior
    > - Providing hooks for users to inject custom exception handlers

26. **How can you implement a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff that handles different types of exceptions differently?**
    > This could involve:
    > - Creating a suspend function that takes the operation as a parameter
    > - Using a loop with exponentially increasing delays
    > - Implementing different retry strategies for different exception types
    > - Using flow or channels to emit progress and allow for external cancellation
    > - Combining with timeouts to prevent infinite retries

27. **What are the best practices for handling exceptions in a coroutine-based actor system?**
    > Best practices might include:
    > - Using supervisorScope to isolate actor failures
    > - Implementing a dead letter queue for unhandled messages
    > - Using channels with capacity and appropriate buffer overflow strategies
    > - Implementing actor-specific exception handlers
    > - Designing a supervision hierarchy for actor restart strategies
    > - Using coroutineScope for operations that should fail together within an actor

28. **How would you implement a coroutine-based saga pattern with proper exception handling and compensating transactions?**
    > Implementation could involve:
    > - Using a coroutine for each step of the saga
    > - Implementing compensating transactions as suspend functions
    > - Using a state machine to track saga progress
    > - Leveraging structured concurrency for proper cancellation and exception propagation
    > - Using channels or flows to communicate between saga steps
    > - Implementing idempotency to handle partial failures and retries

29. **What are the implications and best practices for exception handling in a system using both coroutines and RxJava?**
    > Considerations include:
    > - Clearly defining boundaries between coroutine and RxJava code
    > - Using appropriate adapters to convert between Flowable and Flow
    > - Ensuring consistent exception handling strategies across both paradigms
    > - Being aware of the differences in cancellation behavior
    > - Potentially using a common error model that works well with both systems
    > - Carefully managing thread/dispatcher transitions

30. **How would you design a coroutine-based error handling system for a distributed microservices architecture?**
    > Design considerations might include:
    > - Implementing circuit breakers for inter-service communication
    > - Using coroutines for non-blocking I/O in service calls
    > - Designing a consistent error model across services
    > - Implementing distributed tracing for error tracking across service boundaries
    > - Using supervisorScope to isolate failures in different parts of a service
    > - Implementing retry mechanisms with backoff for transient failures
    > - Designing fallback mechanisms for degraded service operation
    > - Using channels or message queues for asynchronous error reporting and handling
