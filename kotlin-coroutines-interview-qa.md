## Medium Difficulty Questions

### 1. üèóÔ∏è `launch` vs `async`

**Q: What is the difference between `launch` and `async` coroutine builders?**

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

Both `launch` and `async` are coroutine builders, but they have different use cases:
- `launch`:
  - Starts a coroutine that doesn't return a result
  - Returns a `Job` object
- `async`:
  - Used when you need to return a result from the coroutine
  - Returns a `Deferred` object (a light-weight non-blocking future)

</details>

### 2. üè¢ Structured Concurrency

**Q: Explain the concept of structured concurrency in Kotlin Coroutines.**

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

Structured concurrency is a design principle ensuring that coroutines are not lost or leaked:
- Coroutines follow a parent-child hierarchy
- When a parent coroutine is cancelled, all its child coroutines are cancelled too
- A parent coroutine waits for all its children to complete before completing itself

This helps in managing the lifetime of coroutines and prevents resource leaks.

</details>

### 3. ‚è∏Ô∏è Suspend Functions

**Q: What is a suspend function and how does it differ from a regular function?**

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

A suspend function is a function that can be paused and resumed. Key differences:
- Marked with the `suspend` keyword
- Can only be called from within a coroutine or another suspend function
- Can use other suspend functions like `delay()` without blocking the thread
- Transformed into a state machine by the Kotlin compiler

</details>

### 4. üõ°Ô∏è Exception Handling

**Q: How do you handle exceptions in coroutines?**

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

Exceptions in coroutines can be handled using:
- Try-catch blocks within the coroutine
- `CoroutineExceptionHandler` for uncaught exceptions
- `SupervisorJob` to prevent sibling coroutines from cancelling each other
- `runCatching` for functional-style exception handling

</details>

### 5. üß© Coroutine Context

**Q: What is a coroutine context and what are its main elements?**

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

A coroutine context is a set of elements that define the behavior of a coroutine. Main elements include:
- Job: Controls the lifecycle of the coroutine
- Dispatcher: Determines which thread(s) the coroutine runs on
- CoroutineName: Assigns a name to the coroutine for debugging purposes
- CoroutineExceptionHandler: Handles uncaught exceptions

</details>

## Tough Questions

### 1. üî¨ `coroutineScope` vs `supervisorScope`

**Q: Explain the difference between `coroutineScope` and `supervisorScope`. When would you use each?**

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

Both create a new coroutine scope, but differ in exception handling:

`coroutineScope`:
- Cancels all children if any child fails
- Propagates the exception to its parent
- Use for all-or-nothing execution of child coroutines

`supervisorScope`:
- Doesn't cancel other children when one fails
- Doesn't propagate exceptions to its parent automatically
- Use for independent execution of child coroutines

Use `coroutineScope` for dependent tasks, `supervisorScope` for independent tasks.

</details>

### 2. üö´ Coroutine Cancellation

**Q: How does coroutine cancellation work, and what are cancellation points?**

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

Coroutine cancellation works cooperatively:
1. Job's state changes to cancelling
2. `CancellationException` is thrown at the next cancellation point
3. Coroutine runs its cancellation logic and terminates

Cancellation points are typically suspend functions like `yield()`, `delay()`, or `withContext()`.

To make computations cancellable, periodically check `isActive` flag or call `yield()`.

</details>

### 3. ‚è≥ `withContext()` vs `withTimeout()`

**Q: What is the difference between `withContext()` and `withTimeout()`, and when would you use each?**

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

- `withContext(context) { ... }`: Switches the context of a coroutine
  - Use to change dispatchers (e.g., moving to a background thread)

- `withTimeout(timeMillis) { ... }`: Sets a timeout for a block of suspending code
  - Throws `TimeoutCancellationException` if exceeded
  - Use to limit execution time of an operation

</details>

### 4. üåä Flow

**Q: Explain the concept of flow in Kotlin Coroutines and how it differs from sequences.**

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

Flow is for handling streams of asynchronous data. Differences from sequences:
- Asynchronous (sequences are synchronous)
- Can emit values computed asynchronously
- Supports back-pressure out of the box
- Has built-in cancellation support
- Can use coroutine contexts and dispatchers

Used for handling streams from async operations like network requests or database queries.

</details>

### 5. üîÄ `select` Expression

**Q: How does the `select` expression work in Kotlin Coroutines, and what are its use cases?**

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

`select` allows awaiting multiple suspending functions simultaneously, selecting the first available. Use cases:
- Receiving from multiple channels
- Combining timeouts with other operations
- Racing multiple asynchronous operations

Example:
```kotlin
select<Unit> {
    channel1.onReceive { value ->
        println("Received from channel1: $value")
    }
    channel2.onReceive { value ->
        println("Received from channel2: $value")
    }
}
```

</details>

### 6. üì° Channel vs Flow

**Q: What are the differences between `Channel` and `Flow`, and when would you use each?**

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

Channels:
- Hot streams (active even without collectors)
- Multiple senders and receivers
- For coroutine-to-coroutine communication
- Built-in back-pressure support

Flows:
- Cold streams (only active when collected)
- Single sender, multiple collectors
- For asynchronous data streaming
- Rich set of operators for data manipulation

Use Channels for coroutine communication or shared event streams. Use Flow for async sequences, especially with functional-style operations.
