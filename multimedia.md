   - AudioTrack: For playing raw audio data

2. Q: How do you play audio using MediaPlayer?
   A: Here's a basic example of playing audio with MediaPlayer:
   ```kotlin
   val mediaPlayer = MediaPlayer.create(context, R.raw.audio_file)
   mediaPlayer.start()
   ```

3. Q: What is the purpose of the ExoPlayer library?
   A: ExoPlayer is an advanced, flexible media player for Android. It supports features like DASH and SmoothStreaming adaptive playbacks, caching media for offline playback, and customizing and extending the player to better suit complex use cases.

4. Q: How do you capture images using the camera in Android?
   A: You can capture images using the camera by:
   1. Declaring camera permission in the manifest
   2. Using the Camera2 API or CameraX library
   3. Creating a CameraManager
   4. Opening a camera device
   5. Creating a CaptureSession
   6. Capturing the image

5. Q: What is the CameraX library?
   A: CameraX is a Jetpack library that makes it easier to add camera features to your app. It provides a consistent and easy-to-use API that works across most Android devices, with backward-compatibility to Android 5.0 (API level 21).

6. Q: How do you record video in Android?
   A: To record video:
   1. Use MediaRecorder class
   2. Set the video source (usually the camera)
   3. Set the output format and encoding
   4. Set the output file
   5. Prepare the MediaRecorder
   6. Start recording
   7. Stop recording when done

7. Q: What are the main classes for working with images in Android?
   A: The main classes for working with images are:
   - Bitmap: Represents a bitmap image
   - BitmapFactory: Creates Bitmap objects from various sources
   - Canvas: Provides drawing methods for a Bitmap
   - ImageView: UI component for displaying images

8. Q: How can you load and display images efficiently in a RecyclerView?
   A: To efficiently load and display images in a RecyclerView:
   1. Use an image loading library like Glide or Picasso
   2. Implement view recycling correctly
   3. Use placeholder images while loading
   4. Consider using thumbnail images
   5. Implement paging if dealing with large datasets

9. Q: What is the purpose of the ContentResolver class in multimedia handling?
   A: ContentResolver provides access to the content model. It's used to access and modify data stored by content providers, including media files stored on the device.

10. Q: How do you handle audio focus in Android?
    A: To handle audio focus:
    1. Request audio focus using AudioManager.requestAudioFocus()
    2. Handle audio focus changes in the OnAudioFocusChangeListener
    3. Pause or duck audio when focus is lost
    4. Resume playback when focus is regained
    5. Abandon audio focus when done using AudioManager.abandonAudioFocus()

11. Q: What is the MediaStore API?
    A: MediaStore is a system content provider that manages access to media files on the device. It provides a way to query and interact with audio, video, and image files stored on the device.

12. Q: How do you implement a custom video player in Android?
    A: To implement a custom video player:
    1. Use a SurfaceView or TextureView to display the video
    2. Use MediaPlayer or ExoPlayer to handle playback
    3. Implement playback controls (play, pause, seek, etc.)
    4. Handle full-screen mode and orientation changes
    5. Manage audio focus
    6. Implement error handling and buffering states

13. Q: What is the purpose of the MediaCodec class?
    A: MediaCodec is a low-level API for encoding and decoding media. It's used for more advanced scenarios where you need direct control over media processing, such as applying real-time effects to video.

14. Q: How do you implement audio recording in Android?
    A: To implement audio recording:
    1. Request necessary permissions (RECORD_AUDIO)
    2. Create an instance of MediaRecorder
    3. Set the audio source, output format, and encoder
    4. Prepare the MediaRecorder
    5. Start recording
    6. Stop and release the MediaRecorder when done

15. Q: What is the purpose of the MediaMetadataRetriever class?
    A: MediaMetadataRetriever is used to retrieve metadata from media files. It can extract information such as duration, bit rate, frame rate, and album art from audio and video files.

16. Q: How do you implement pinch-to-zoom for images in Android?
    A: To implement pinch-to-zoom:
    1. Use a custom ImageView or a library like PhotoView
    2. Implement ScaleGestureDetector to detect pinch gestures
    3. Apply scale and translation transformations to the image based on gesture input
    4. Use Matrix to manage and apply these transformations

17. Q: What is the purpose of the MediaRouter API?
    A: MediaRouter API is used for discovering and controlling external playback routes, such as Google Cast devices. It allows you to send audio and video content to external devices.

18. Q: How do you handle different audio output devices (like Bluetooth headsets)?
    A: To handle different audio output devices:
    1. Use AudioManager to detect available audio devices
    2. Register an AudioDeviceCallback to be notified of device changes
    3. Use setPreferredDevice() to route audio to a specific device
    4. Handle device disconnections and switch to appropriate fallback devices

19. Q: What is the purpose of the ExifInterface class?
    A: ExifInterface is used to read and write Exif tags in image files. These tags contain metadata about the image, such as camera settings, GPS information, and timestamps.

20. Q: How do you implement background audio playback in Android?
    A: To implement background audio playback:
    1. Use a Service (preferably a foreground service) to handle playback
    2. Implement a notification to control playback from outside the app
    3. Handle audio focus to respond to other audio events
    4. Use MediaSession to integrate with the system media controls
    5. Implement proper lifecycle management to handle app closure and reopening
