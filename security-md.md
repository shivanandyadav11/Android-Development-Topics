# Security

1. Q: What is ProGuard and how does it enhance security?
   A: ProGuard is a code obfuscator for Java bytecode. It renames classes, fields, and methods using short meaningless names, making it difficult for someone to reverse engineer your code. This enhances security by making it harder for attackers to understand and exploit your app's logic.

2. Q: How can you securely store sensitive data in Android?
   A: For secure data storage:
   - Use Android Keystore System for storing cryptographic keys
   - Use EncryptedSharedPreferences for sensitive key-value pairs
   - Use SQLCipher for database encryption
   - Never store sensitive information in plain text

3. Q: What is SSL pinning and why is it important?
   A: SSL pinning is the practice of associating a host with its expected X509 certificate or public key. It's important because it prevents man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring your app only communicates with the intended server.

4. Q: How can you implement SSL pinning in Android?
   A: You can implement SSL pinning by:
   - Including the server's certificate in your app
   - Using OkHttp's CertificatePinner
   - Using the Network Security Configuration feature (Android 7.0+)

5. Q: What is the purpose of the Android Keystore System?
   A: The Android Keystore System allows you to store cryptographic keys in a container, making it more difficult to extract from the device. The key material is protected from unauthorized use and is bound to the device's secure hardware.

6. Q: How can you protect your app from reverse engineering?
   A: To protect your app from reverse engineering:
   - Use ProGuard for code obfuscation
   - Implement root detection
   - Use native code (NDK) for sensitive operations
   - Implement tamper detection
   - Use DexGuard (a commercial tool) for advanced obfuscation

7. Q: What is SQL injection and how can you prevent it?
   A: SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications. To prevent it:
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Use SQLiteDatabase's query() method instead of raw queries
   - Validate and sanitize user input
   - Use Room database, which provides compile-time verification of SQL queries

8. Q: How can you securely implement authentication in Android?
   A: For secure authentication:
   - Use HTTPS for all network communications
   - Implement token-based authentication
   - Store authentication tokens securely (e.g., EncryptedSharedPreferences)
   - Use biometric authentication when available
   - Implement proper session management

9. Q: What is the importance of input validation?
   A: Input validation is crucial for security as it helps prevent various attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflow. Always validate and sanitize user input before processing or storing it.

10. Q: How can you protect your app from content provider leakage?
    A: To protect content providers:
    - Set android:exported="false" for providers not intended for external use
    - Use signature-level permissions for providers that should only be accessed by your own apps
    - Implement proper input validation for any data received through content providers

11. Q: What is the purpose of the Network Security Configuration feature?
    A: The Network Security Configuration feature allows you to customize network security settings in a declarative configuration file without modifying app code. It can be used to:
    - Customize trust anchors (e.g., for SSL pinning)
    - Only permit secure connections for specific domains
    - Prevent unencrypted traffic for all domains

12. Q: How can you secure your app's network communication?
    A: To secure network communication:
    - Use HTTPS for all network requests
    - Implement SSL pinning
    - Use the Network Security Configuration to enforce secure connections
    - Validate server certificates
    - Use secure protocols and ciphers

13. Q: What is root detection and why is it important?
    A: Root detection is the process of determining if a device is rooted (has superuser access). It's important because rooted devices can bypass certain security measures, potentially compromising your app's security.

14. Q: How can you implement root detection in your app?
    A: You can implement root detection by:
    - Checking for the presence of su binary
    - Checking for common root management apps
    - Checking for read/write access to system directories
    - Using SafetyNet Attestation API
    Note that determined users can still bypass these checks.

15. Q: What is the SafetyNet Attestation API?
    A: The SafetyNet Attestation API is a Google Play service that checks whether a device's software and hardware environment is considered secure based on Google's standards. It can be used to detect potentially harmful devices or environments.

16. Q: How can you protect sensitive data in transit?
    A: To protect data in transit:
    - Use HTTPS for all network communications
    - Implement SSL pinning
    - Use strong encryption algorithms
    - Avoid sending sensitive data in URL parameters
    - Use token-based authentication instead of sending credentials with each request

17. Q: What is the principle of least privilege and how does it apply to Android security?
    A: The principle of least privilege states that every part of a system must be able to access only the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose. In Android, this means:
    - Only request permissions that are absolutely necessary for your app's functionality
    - Use fine-grained permissions when possible
    - Use intents to delegate actions to other apps when appropriate

18. Q: How can you secure your app's components (Activities, Services, etc.)?
    A: To secure app components:
    - Use explicit intents for internal app communication
    - Set android:exported="false" for components not intended for external use
    - Use custom permissions to restrict access to your app's components
    - Validate all input received through intents

19. Q: What are some best practices for securing WebViews?
    A: To secure WebViews:
    - Disable JavaScript if not needed
    - Disable file access
    - Only load content over HTTPS
    - Validate all user input
    - Use WebViewClient.shouldOverrideUrlLoading() to restrict which URLs can be loaded
    - Avoid calling loadUrl() with user-supplied data

20. Q: How can you implement secure data backup in Android?
    A: For secure data backup:
    - Use Auto Backup with encryption enabled (Android 6.0+)
    - Implement your own backup system using the Backup API
    - Encrypt sensitive data before backing it up
    - Use android:allowBackup="false" in the manifest for apps that shouldn't be backed up
    - Implement a restore mechanism that validates and sanitizes restored data
