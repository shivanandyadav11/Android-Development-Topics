# Testing

1. Q: What are the main types of tests in Android?
   A: The main types of tests in Android are:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - UI tests (also known as instrumented tests)

2. Q: What is JUnit?
   A: JUnit is a popular unit testing framework for Java that is also used for Android testing. It provides annotations to identify test methods and assertions to check expected results.

3. Q: How do you write a simple JUnit test in Android?
   A: Here's an example of a simple JUnit test:
   ```kotlin
   @Test
   fun addition_isCorrect() {
       assertEquals(4, 2 + 2)
   }
   ```

4. Q: What is Mockito?
   A: Mockito is a popular mocking framework used in unit testing. It allows you to create and configure mock objects, which can be used to simulate the behavior of complex, real objects.

5. Q: How do you use Mockito in Android testing?
   A: Here's a simple example of using Mockito:
   ```kotlin
   @Test
   fun testViewModel() {
       val repository = mock(UserRepository::class.java)
       `when`(repository.getUser()).thenReturn(User("John"))
       
       val viewModel = UserViewModel(repository)
       assertEquals("John", viewModel.userName)
   }
   ```

6. Q: What is Espresso?
   A: Espresso is a testing framework for Android to make it easy to write reliable UI tests. It provides a set of APIs to simulate user interactions and make assertions on View objects.

7. Q: How do you write a simple Espresso test?
   A: Here's an example of a simple Espresso test:
   ```kotlin
   @Test
   fun greeterSaysHello() {
       onView(withId(R.id.name_field)).perform(typeText("Steve"))
       onView(withId(R.id.greet_button)).perform(click())
       onView(withId(R.id.greeting)).check(matches(withText("Hello Steve!")))
   }
   ```

8. Q: What is the purpose of the AndroidJUnitRunner?
   A: AndroidJUnitRunner is a JUnit test runner that lets you run JUnit 3 or JUnit 4-style test classes on Android devices, including those using the Espresso and UI Automator testing frameworks.

9. Q: How do you run instrumented tests in Android?
   A: You can run instrumented tests using the Android Studio IDE by right-clicking on the test or test class and selecting "Run", or from the command line using:
   ```
   ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
   ```

10. Q: What is UI Automator?
    A: UI Automator is a UI testing framework suitable for cross-app functional UI testing across system and installed apps. It provides a set of APIs to build UI tests that perform interactions on user apps and system apps.

11. Q: What is the difference between Espresso and UI Automator?
    A: Espresso is designed for testing a single app and provides more robust synchronization capabilities. UI Automator is designed for testing interactions between multiple apps and can interact with system UI elements.

12. Q: What is Robolectric?
    A: Robolectric is a framework that allows you to run Android tests on a regular JVM, without needing an emulator or physical device. This can significantly speed up the execution of tests.

13. Q: How do you use Robolectric in your tests?
    A: To use Robolectric, you need to add the @RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner::class) annotation to your test class:
    ```kotlin
    @RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner::class)
    class MyActivityTest {
        @Test
        fun clickingButton_shouldChangeText() {
            val activity = Robolectric.setupActivity(MyActivity::class.java)
            activity.findViewById<Button>(R.id.button).performClick()
            assertEquals("Clicked", activity.findViewById<TextView>(R.id.text).text)
        }
    }
    ```

14. Q: What is a test double?
    A: A test double is an object that can stand in for a real object in a test. There are several types of test doubles, including mocks, stubs, and fakes.

15. Q: What is the purpose of the @Before annotation in JUnit?
    A: The @Before annotation is used to specify a method that should run before each test method. It's typically used to set up test fixtures or initialize objects that will be used in multiple tests.

16. Q: How do you test coroutines in Android?
    A: You can test coroutines using the kotlinx-coroutines-test library, which provides utilities like runBlockingTest:
    ```kotlin
    @Test
    fun testSuspendFunction() = runBlockingTest {
        val result = mySuspendFunction()
        assertEquals(expected, result)
    }
    ```

17. Q: What is code coverage and how can you measure it in Android?
    A: Code coverage is a measure of how much of your code is executed during your tests. In Android, you can use JaCoCo to generate code coverage reports. You can enable it in your module's build.gradle file:
    ```groovy
    android {
        buildTypes {
            debug {
                testCoverageEnabled true
            }
        }
    }
    ```

18. Q: What is the purpose of idling resources in Espresso?
    A: Idling resources are used to synchronize your tests with long-running operations in your app. They tell Espresso when the app is "idle" and it's safe to proceed with the next test action.

19. Q: How do you test Room database operations?
    A: You can test Room database operations using in-memory databases. Here's an example:
    ```kotlin
    @RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class)
    class UserDaoTest {
        private lateinit var userDao: UserDao
        private lateinit var db: AppDatabase

        @Before
        fun createDb() {
            val context = ApplicationProvider.getApplicationContext<Context>()
            db = Room.inMemoryDatabaseBuilder(context, AppDatabase::class.java).build()
            userDao = db.userDao()
        }

        @After
        @Throws(IOException::class)
        fun closeDb() {
            db.close()
        }

        @Test
        @Throws(Exception::class)
        fun writeUserAndReadInList() {
            val user = User("name")
            userDao.insert(user)
            val byName = userDao.findByName("name")
            assertEquals(user, byName[0])
        }
    }
    ```

20. Q: What is Test-Driven Development (TDD) in the context of Android development?
    A: Test-Driven Development is a software development process where you write tests before writing the actual code. In Android, this might involve writing unit tests for your ViewModels or use cases, UI tests for your activities and fragments, and integration tests for your data sources before implementing these components.
